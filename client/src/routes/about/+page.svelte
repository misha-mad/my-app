    <p class="text-xl mb-4">
      Hey there! I'm Misha, a passionate full-stack developer with a journey spanning several years. My coding adventure
      involves crafting both the frontend and backend, exploring the ever-evolving tech landscape. Let me share a bit
      more about my technological journey.
    </p>

    <p class="text-xl mb-4">
      In the realm of frontend, I wield the power of TypeScript, React, and Svelte to create seamless and interactive
      user interfaces. These tools, with their versatility and efficiency, enable me to bring design concepts to life
      with elegance and precision.
    </p>

    <p class="text-xl mb-4">
      On the backend frontier, I navigate the realms of GraphQL, Hasura, Docker, and Postgres. Crafting robust
      server-side logic and designing efficient databases, I ensure that the backend infrastructure seamlessly supports
      the frontend's ambitions.
    </p>

    <p class="text-xl mb-4">
      My journey also includes mastering version control with Git, exploring the utility and flexibility of Tailwind CSS
      for styling, and delving into the world of Rust for systems programming. This diverse skill set empowers me to
      create scalable and performant applications.
    </p>

    <p class="text-xl mb-4">
      Additionally, I navigate the cloud with AWS, ensuring applications are deployed and scaled effortlessly. This
      expertise completes the full-stack circle, allowing me to architect and deploy end-to-end solutions.
    </p>

    <p class="text-xl mb-4">
      Join me on this exciting coding journey, where every line of code is a step towards building innovative and
      impactful solutions. Whether it's a web application, a RESTful API, or a cloud-native service, I'm ready to tackle
      the challenge head-on!
